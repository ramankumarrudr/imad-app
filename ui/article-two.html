        <p>
        HTTPS (also called HTTP over Transport Layer Security (TLS),[1] HTTP over SSL,[2] and HTTP Secure[3][4]) is a communications protocol for secure communication over a computer network which is widely used on the Internet. HTTPS consists of communication over Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) within a connection encrypted by Transport Layer Security, or its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer. The main motivation for HTTPS is authentication of the visited website and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data.
